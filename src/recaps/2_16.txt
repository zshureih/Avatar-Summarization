s - 10 - Scene Description:  The two sandbenders jump onto Appa's saddle, stirring some sand. Appa sneezes, sending the center sailer into a sand dune. Cut to Ghashiun and a sandbender, who talk while, in the background, two sandbenders throw the contents of Appa's saddle in the background onto the ground.
m - 12 - Ghashiun:  Nothing. It's the one we stole from the Hami Tribe. [To the two sandbenders on Appa's saddle.] Did you empty the saddle? [Walks up to Sokka's club among a sleeping pad and parasol.] That's it? Nothing but garbage!
s - 12 - Scene Description:  The other sandbender picks up the parasol and opens it. Cut to a small camp of merchants which the sandbenders bring Appa to using the two remaining sand-sailers. Three merchants walk around Appa's head to bargain with Ghashiun.

s - 21 - Ghashiun:  [Sailing away with his sandbenders.] He's your problem now! [Laughs.]
m - 25 - Merchant #1:  We need the shirshu spit darts!
s - 26 - Aang:  Appa! [The camera pans up to the empty desert. Aang's eyes start watering and he closes them.] No. [Opens his eyes with anger.] No! [Slams his glider against the ground, using airbending to send sand up into the air.]

A small boy walks past, but walks back when he sees Appa try to suck up a bale of hay in the tent. The boy looks questioningly at Appa, who licks the bar of the cage. The boy looks understandingly at the sky bison and the boy's father walks behind him.
m - 40 - Shuzumu:  [Closer shot of him and the trainer.] Too risky? What are you talking about? [Raises his hands up.] This is the circus, home of fear and danger. [Points at Appa.] I want the wind buffalo to perform tonight.
m - 44 - Shuzumu:  [Voice-over.] Ladies and gentlemen, now for something truly special. [Frontal shot. Creates two flames with his hands.] A noble beast, so magnificent and rare, it hasn't been seen by human eyes in generations. I give you ... the wind buffalo!
m - 49 - Iio:  Choose well. A sky bison is a companion for life.
m - 60 - Suki:  No sudden movements. He's been lost for a while and he looks like he's hurt. [Closer shot of the Kyoshi Warriors.] He's shy around people and scared. Stay low and stay quiet.
m - 78 - Azula:  No Avatar, huh. Well, that's okay. Any friend of the Avatar [Jumps off the mongoose lizard.] is an enemy of mine! [Firebends at Appa, who the Kyoshi Warriors protect by moving their shields together.]
m - 89 - Pathik:  Someone looks very well rested, [Cut to Appa, whose fur on one side of his head is slightly messed up.] judging by your bed head. [Appa growls and shakes away the bed head.]
