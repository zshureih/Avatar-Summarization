m - 40 - Katara:  [Turns around; furiously.] Oh, everyone trusts you now! I was the first person to trust you! [Places her left hand on her heart.] Remember, back in Ba Sing Se. [Points to the ocean.] And you turned around and betrayed me, betrayed all of us!
m - 44 - Katara:  [Cuts to shot of her and Zuko standing on the cliff as she approaches him while snapping at him angrily.] You really want to know? Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. [Cuts to side-view of her and Zuko.] Or, I know! You could bring my mother back!
m - 48 - Sokka:  Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation.
