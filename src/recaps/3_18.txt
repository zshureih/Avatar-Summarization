s - 1 - Zuko:  More ferocious! Imagine striking through your opponent's heart!
m - 3 - Zuko:  Now let me hear you roar like a tigerdillo! [Aang gives a light roar as fire bursts come out of his hands and mouth; cuts to a front scene of his embarrassed grin.] That sounded pathetic! I said roar!
m - 10 - Scene Description:  Dives excitedly out of the camera's view. Camera changes scene to the ocean to show that he entered the water with a splash. Sokka surfaces with seaweed on his head and he blows water from his mouth. He grins goofily. Katara uses waterbending to create an ice surfboard and surfs on the water. Cut to Suki, watching Sokka grab some seaweed and bring it to an area. He takes two buckets and fills them with water. Aang sticks the last piece of wood on a life-sized sand sculpture of Appa, finishing the last horn.
s - 13 - Toph:  Not bad, baldy, [Aang jumps off the sculpture.] but I've been working on my sandbending. [Cracks her fingers.] You're gonna love this.
m - 25 - Scene Description:  He is cut off by a fire blast that destroys the sculpture. Zuko appears and chases after Aang, blasting at him with firebending. Aang jumps over the sand replica of Ba Sing Se and Zuko destroys the replica. Aang hides behind his Appa sand sculpture.
s - 44 - Zuko:  You're wrong. [Turns away from them.] It's about to get worse than you can even imagine. [Flashes back to one day before the Day of Black Sun. Servants help Zuko get dressed on his way to a meeting. Once done, they stay behind and bow to him as he walks on. Voice-over.] The day before the eclipse, my father asked me to attend an important war meeting. It was what I dreamed about for so many years. My father had finally accepted me back.
m - 70 - Sokka:  All right! Team Avatar is back! Air. [Shot of Aang.] Water. [Shot of Katara.] Earth. [Shot of Toph.] Fire. [Shot of Zuko. Sokka gives Suki a clump of leaves and holds up a large leaf.] Fan and sword! [Sokka's leaf wilts.]
s - 73 - Zuko:  There's one technique you need to know before facing my father - how to redirect lightning. [Aang smiles.] If you let the energy in your own body flow, the lightning will follow it. [Uses his fingers to show how the energy should flow through the body.] You turn your opponents' energy against them.
s - 80 - Aang:  [Chuckles.] Well, not over over. I mean there's always Katara and a little Spirit Water action, [Turns to Katara.] am I right?
s - 83 - Zuko:  [Stops practicing the lightning redirection form.] Exhilarating ... [Flashes back to the moment for a few seconds.] but terrifying. You feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body, but you know if you make the wrong move, it's over.
m - 99 - Scene Description:  Aang jumps, preparing to strike the Melon Lord with his glider staff. Aang looks at the Melon Lord and changes expressions from anger to uncertainty. When he lands, Aang stops his attack just before smashing the Melon Lord. He backs away.
s - 121 - Zuko:  [Sarcastically.] Yeah, then you can show him his baby pictures, and all those happy memories will make him good again. [Suki and Sokka laugh in the background.]
m - 154 - Actress Aang:  [In the center of the crowd.] Avatar State! [Actor Toph lifts her up in the air.] Yip-yip! [Crowd cheers.]
s - 162 - Zuko:  [Sighs and stops walking.] Look, I know you had a really rough childhood, but we should really focus on finding Aang. [Continues walking.]
m - 170 - Katara:  Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang.
m - 188 - Scene Description:  Servants pull up the phoenix emblem behind Ozai. Soldiers raise the phoenix flags beside the Fire Nation flags. Two more soldiers firebend into the base of the flag pole, causing fire to shoot out at the sides. The crowd bows before their new king. The camera cuts to Ozai and zooms out. Cut to an aerial view of a tavern as Team Avatar approaches. Inside the tavern, lively music plays. Zuko enters, followed by Katara, Sokka, Suki, and Toph.
