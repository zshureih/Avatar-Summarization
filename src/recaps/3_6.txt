m - 24 - Roku:  To visit my past. [He smiles at Aang, as Aang grins widely.] Our shared past.
m - 68 - Gyatso:  [Laughing.] Check this out! [He flips himself over and stands on top of his glider. Cut to Aang and Roku.]
s - 72 - Roku:  [Camera pans back to show Roku.] Some friendships are so strong, [He closes his eyes.] they can even transcend lifetimes.
m - 81 - Scene Description:  Scene changes to Zuko, still reading Sozin's history in the chamber. An extreme close-up shows his eyes quivering with each word he reads.
m - 85 - Sozin:  [Scene changes to Sozin from below him. Serious.] Customarily, my subjects bow before greeting me. [He walks down from his throne.] But you're the exception. [He smiles and hugs Roku.]
s - 86 - Roku:  After all these years, he was still my best friend. [Scene changes to a wedding ceremony and celebration in a Fire Nation courtyard, with many guests attending. Cut to Roku, on whose right is Sozin, holding a scroll.] And a few months later, he was my best man.
s - 87 - Roku:  Ta Min. I was persistent. [She stands up near Roku.] When love is real, it finds a way. [The attendees clap, as the newly-wed couple bow their heads. Cut to a shot of the couple from the side, as Aang and Roku watch.] And being the Avatar doesn't hurt your chances with the ladies, either.
m - 89 - Scene Description:  Scene changes to Zuko.
m - 91 - Sozin:  On wedding days, we look to the future with optimism and joy. [Fade to Sozin in deep thought.] I had my own vision for a brighter future.
s - 102 - Roku:  [His spirit speaks to Aang.] That was my first real test as the Avatar. Unfortunately, it was many years before I learned [Cut to a extreme close-up of Sozin.] that Sozin [Sozin narrows his eyes. Fade to a back-shot of Fang flying with Roku.] had gone ahead with his plan, despite my warning.
s - 106 - Roku:  I'm sparing you, Sozin. [Cut to a frontal shot of Roku.] I'm letting you go in the name of our past friendship. But I warn you. [Cut to a extreme close up of Roku.] Even a single step out of line will result in your permanent end.
m - 110 - Roku:  Let's go! [He catches his wife's hand, and airbends smoke and ash in their way, creating a path, as both run through the path he created.]
s - 132 - Roku:  Make sense of our past, Aang. [Cut to Roku and Aang.] And you will bring peace, and restore balance in the world. [He slowly disappears.]
s - 142 - Toph:  [Camera pans to Toph, and cuts to a close-up of her face.] Do you really think friendships can last more than one lifetime?
m - 150 - Scene Description:  Sokka stops talking, and without moving, he thrusts out his hand to hold Katara's. Shot cuts to an aerial shot of Team Avatar, holding hands, and looking out toward the ocean. Fade to credits.
